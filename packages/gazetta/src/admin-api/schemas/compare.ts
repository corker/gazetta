/**
 * Zod schema for /api/compare — logical diff between source and target.
 *
 * Mirrors the `CompareResult` type that compare.ts returns from
 * `compareTargets`. The server sends it verbatim via `c.json(result)`,
 * so the wire shape is identical to the compare function's return
 * type. Keeping both defined through z.infer means there's a single
 * source of truth rather than a TS interface *and* a Zod schema that
 * could drift apart.
